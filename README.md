# zpl-printer

This is a hack of an old fork for a bandaid to get get some sort of virtual zpl running for previewing zpl labels in development. 
currently hardcoded to run on 9100. Would be a nice app to rebuild with vue/react... 

- I'm refactoring the old (story of my life). Previous dev did a good job when it was built but that was likely early 2010s... a bit has changed since then :P
